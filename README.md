## Top Secret Hangman

An [AngularJS Hangman Game](https://rockwotj-top-secret-hangman.appspot.com/) that teaches you different 'codes' at the same time. i.e. Morse Code, Braille, ASCII.

## But why?

This was developed in order to be a learning experience for Tyler Rockwood's 2015 Spring Independent Study with Dr. David Fisher. It uses the following technology stack:

1. Google App Engine
1. Javascript Endpoints
1. Endpoints OAuth
1. Polymer Web Components
1. AngularJS
1. Google Cloud Datastore

This may or may not eventually become a lab for student looking to learn similar skills. I can only hope it helps you learn as much as it did me!

## Origins

This webapp started out as [App Engine AngularJS "Hello World" Python](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/appengine-angular-hello-world-python) starting template provided by Google Cloud Platform.
